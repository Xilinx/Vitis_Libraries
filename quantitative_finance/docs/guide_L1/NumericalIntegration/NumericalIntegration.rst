Numerical Integration Methods
*****************************

Overview
========

Three Numerical Integration methods are included: the Adaptive Trapezoidal method, the Adaptive Simpson method and the Romberg method. 

Adaptive Trapezoidal Theory
===========================

The trapezoidal rule works by splitting the function to be integrated up into a number of equal chunks and for each chunk, the curve is approximated by a straight line; in effect, the curve is approximated by a number of trapezoids. The area under the curve then can be approximated by summing the area of all the trapezoids. See `wiki Trapezoidal entry`_ for the theory.

The Adaptive Trapezoidal rule takes advantage of the fact that a curve, or part of a curve, that is fairly straight (a small second derivative) needs far fewer chunks than a rapidly changing part of the curve. This rule chunks up the curve in a variable way only using more chunks where they are absolutely required. The algorithm uses a required tolerance to determine how many chunks a given part of the curve requires.

Adaptive Simpson Theory
=======================

The Simpson rule works in a very similar way to the Trapezoidal. However, rather than approximating the curve with a series of straight lines, it approximated the curves with a number of quadratic curves. See `wiki Simpson entry`_ and `wiki Adaptive Simpson entry`_ for the theory.

Romberg Theory
==============

The Romberg method uses a combination of the Trapezoidal Rule and Richardson's Extrapolation to approximate the integral. Richardson's Extrapolation uses a weighted combination of two estimates to generate a more accurate third estimate. See `wiki Romberg entry`_ for the theory.
