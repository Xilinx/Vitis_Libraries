# Vitis Quantitative Finance Library

The Vitis Quantitative Finance Library is an fundamental library aimed at providing a comprehensive FPGA acceleration library for quantitative finance.
It is an open-sourced library for a variety of real use cases, such as modeling, trading, evaluation, risk-management and so on.

The Vitis Quantitative Finance Library provides comprehensive tools from the bottom up for quantitative finance. It includes the lowest level containing basic modules and functions, the middle level providing pre-defined kernels, and the third level as pure software APIs working with pre-defined hardware overlays.

* At the lowest level (L1), it offers useful statistical functions, numerical methods and linear algebra functions to support practical user to implement advanced modeling, such as Random Number Generator (RNG), Monte Carlo Simulation (MC), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), unique matrix solvers and so on.

* In the middle level (L2), pricing engines are provided as kernel to evaluate common finance derivatives, such as equity products, interest-rate products, foreign exchange (FX) products, and credit products.

## Requirements

### Software Platform

This library is designed to work with Vitis 2022.1 and later, and therefore inherits the system requirements of Vitis and XRT.

Supported operating systems are RHEL/CentOS 7.4, 7.5.
With CentOS/RHEL 7.4 and 7.5, C++11/C++14 should be enabled via
[devtoolset-6](https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/rhscl/devtoolset-6/).

### PCIE Accelerator Card

Hardware modules and kernels are designed to work with Alveo cards. Specific requirements are noted against each kernel or demonstration. Hardware builds for Alveo board targets require package installs as per:
* [Alveo U200](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u200.html#gettingStarted)
* [Alveo U250](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u250.html#gettingStarted)

### Shell Environment

Setup the build environment using the Vitis and XRT scripts, and set the PLATFORM_REPO_PATHS to installation folder of platform files.

```console
    $ source <install path>/Vitis/2022.1/settings64.sh
    $ source /opt/xilinx/xrt/setup.sh
    $ export PLATFORM_REPO_PATHS=/opt/xilinx/platforms
```

## Source Files and Application Development
Vitis libraries are organized into L1 and L2 folders, each relating to a different stage of application development.

**L1** :
      Makefiles and sources in L1 facilitate HLS based flow for quick checks. Tasks at this level include:

* Check the functionality of an individual kernel (C-simulation)
* Estimate resource usage, latency, etc. (Synthesis)
* Run cycle accurate simulations (Co-simulation)
* Package as IP and get final resource utilization/timing details (Export RTL)
       
	**Note**:  Once RTL (or XO file after packaging IP) is generated, the Vivado flow is invoked for XCLBIN file generation if required.

**L2** :
       Makefiles and sources in L2 facilitate building XCLBIN file from various sources (HDL, HLS or XO files) of kernels with host code written in OpenCL/XRT framework targeting a device. This flow supports:

* Software emulation to check the functionality
* Hardware emulation to check RTL level simulation
* Build and test on hardware


## Design Flows

Recommended design flows are categorized by the target level:

* L1
* L2

The common tool and library prerequisites that apply across all design flows are documented in the requirements section above.

### L1

L1 provides the low-level primitives used to build kernels.

The recommended flow to evaluate and test L1 components is described as follows using the Vitis HLS tool. A top level C/C++ testbench (typically `main.cpp` or `tb.cpp`) prepares the input data, passes this to the design under test (typically `dut.cpp` which makes the L1 level library calls) then performs any output data post processing and validation checks.

A Makefile is used to drive this flow with available steps including `CSIM` (high level simulation), `CSYNTH` (high level synthesis to RTL), `COSIM` (cosimulation between software testbench and generated RTL), VIVADO_SYN (synthesis by Vivado), and VIVADO_IMPL (implementation by Vivado). The flow is launched from the shell by calling `make` with variables set as in the example below:

```console
# entering specific unit test project
$ cd L1/tests/specific_algorithm/
# Only run C++ simulation on U250
$ make run CSIM=1 CSYNTH=0 COSIM=0 VIVADO_SYN=0 VIVADO_IMPL=0 PLATFORM=u250_xdma_201830_1
```

As well as verifying functional correctness, the reports generated from this flow give an indication of logic utilization, timing performance, latency and throughput. The output files of interest can be located at the location examples as below where the file names are correlated with the source code. i.e. the callable functions within the design under test.

    Simulation Log: <library_root>/L1/tests/bk_model/prj/solution1/csim/report/dut_csim.log
    Synthesis Report: <library_root>/L1/tests/bk_model/prj/solution1/syn/report/dut_csynth.rpt

### L2

L2 provides the pricing engine APIs presented as kernels.

The available flow for L2 based around the SDAccel tool facilitates the generation and packaging of pricing engine kernels along with the required host application for configuration and control. In addition to supporting FPGA platform targets, emulation options are available for preliminary investigations or where dedicated access to a hardware platform may not be available. hardware emulation is available, hardware emulation performs a cycle-accurate simulation of the generated RTL for the kernel. This flow is makefile driven from the console where the target is selected as a command line parameter as in the examples below:

```console
$ cd L2/tests/GarmanKohlhagenEngine

# build and run one of the following using U250 platform
#  * hardware emulation
#  * actual deployment on physical platform

$ make run TARGET=hw_emu PLATFORM=u250_xdma_201830_1
$ make run TARET=hw PLATFORM=u250_xdma_201830_1

# delete all xclbin and host binary
$ make cleanall
```

The outputs of this flow are packaged kernel binaries (xclbin files) that can be downloaded to the FPGA platform and host executables to configure and co-ordinate data transfers. The output files of interest can be located at the locations examples as below where the file names are correlated with the source code

    Host Executable: L2/tests/GarmanKohlhagenEngine/bin_#PLATFORM/gk_test.exe
    Kernel Packaged Binary: L2/tests/GarmanKohlhagenEngine/xclbin_#PLATFORM_#TARGET/gk_kernel.xclbin #ARGS

This flow can be used to verify functional correctness in hardware and enable real world performance to be measured.

## Benchmark Result
In `L2/benchmarks`, Kernels are built into xclbins targeting Alveo U200/U250. We achieved a good performance. For more details about the benchmarks, please kindly find them in [benchmark results](https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/Vitis_Libraries/quantitative_finance/benchmark.html).
