## Black-Scholes Closed Form Demonstration
This is a demonstration of the Black-Scholes (BS) closed form solver built using the Vitis environment.  It supports hardware emulation as well as running the hardware accelerator on supported Alveo cards.

The demonstration generates a configurable number of randomized input parameter sets (one input parameter set consists of the underlying, volatility, risk free rate, time-to-maturity and strike price), passes them to the kernel and retrieves the pricing and associated Greeks.  These are then compared to a full precision model and the worst case difference between the kernel and model are displayed.

## Prerequisites

- Xilinx Vitis 2020.1 installed and configured
- Xilinx runtime (XRT) installed
- Supported Xilinx Board (e.g. Alveo U250) installed and configured as per https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u250.html#gettingStarted

## Building the demonstration
The kernel and host application are built using a command line Makefile flow.

### Step 1 :
Setup the build environment using the Vitis and XRT scripts:

            source <install path>/Vitis/2020.1/settings64.sh
            source /opt/xilinx/xrt/setup.sh

### Step 2 :
Call the Makefile passing in the intended target and device. The Makefile supports hardware emulation and hardware targets ('hw_emu' and 'hw', respectively). For example to build and run the test application:

            make run TARGET=hw_emu PLATFORM=xilinx_u250_xdma_201830_2

Alternatively use 'all' to build the output products without running the application:

            make all TARGET=hw_emu PLATFORM=xilinx_u250_xdma_201830_2

For all Makefile targets, the host application and xclbin are delivered to named folders depending on the target and part selected.  For example, the command above will produce:

            ./bin_xilinx_u250_xdma_201830_2/bs_test.exe
            ./xclbin_xilinx_u250_xdma_201830_2_hw_emu/bs_kernel.xclbin

These output products can be used directly from the command line.  The application takes the xclbin as the first argument along followed by the number of test parameters to generate.  Due the parallel nature of the processing, the kernel processes input sets in multiples of 16 so the host will round up the number of parameters if required.


The hardware emulation can be run in a similar way, but a smaller number of parameters should be used as an RTL simulation is used under-the-hood:

            export XCL_EMULATION_MODE=hw_emu
            ./bin_xilinx_u250_xdma_201830_2/bs_test.exe ./xclbin_xilinx_u250_xdma_201830_2_hw_emu/bs_kernel.xclbin 4096

Assuming an Alveo U250 card with the XRT configured the hardware build is run in the same way.  Here a much large number of parameters should be used to fully exercise the DDR bandwidth:

            unset XCL_EMULATION_MODE
            ./bin_xilinx_u250_xdma_201830_2/bs_test.exe ./xclbin_xilinx_u250_xdma_201830_2_hw/bs_kernel.xclbin 4194304

## Example Output
This is an example output from the demonstration using a hw_emu target.

There will be a difference seen between the kernel and host data.  This error arises from the use of floats for the internal kernel processing and the approximation to erfc() which is required by the closed-form solution.
