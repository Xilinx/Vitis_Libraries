## Portfolio Optimisation L2 Test 
This is a test of the Portfolio Optimisation model using the Vitis environment.  It supports hardware emulation as well as running the hardware accelerator on supported Alveo cards.

It uses a fixed set of test data with expected values as calculated by the C Model the kernel was developed from. The test will take the input data and calculate asset weights, portfolio expected return and portfolio variance for 4 different types of portfolio; the Global Miminum Variance Portfolio, an Efficient Portfolio of risky assets for a given target return, the Tangency Portfolio for a given risk free rate and an Efficient Portfolio composed of risky assets and a risk free asset for given target return and risk free rate.

## Prerequisites
- Alveo card (eg U200) installed and configured as per https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u200.html#gettingStarted
- Xilinx runtime (XRT) installed
- Xilinx Vitis 2020.1 installed and configured

## Building the Finite Difference demonstration
The demonstration application and kernel is built using a command line Makefile flow.

### Step 1 :
Setup the build environment using the Vitis and XRT scripts:

            source <install path>/Vitis/2020.1/settings64.sh
            source /opt/xilinx/xrt/setup.sh

### Step 2 :
Call the Makefile. For example:

	make check TARGET=hw_emu PLATFORMS=xilinx_u200_xdma_201830_2

	make all TARGET=hw PLATFORMS=xilinx_u200_xdma_201830_2
        
	make run TARGET=hw PLATFORMS=xilinx_u200_xdma_201830_2

The Makefile supports hardware emulation and hardware targets ('hw_emu' and 'hw', respectively).



If the make check ior run option is used the demo will automatically be lauched.
