## Numerical Integration Test
This is a demonstration of using the Numerical Integration library to solve an integration using the Vitis environment.  It supports hardware emulation as well as running the hardware accelerator on supported Alveo cards.

It uses pre-canned test data to integrate a polynomial between various limits. The host uses the exact integration formula and the host generated results are compared with the kernel generated results. The kernel is run three times; once using the Adaptive Trapezoidal rule, once using the Adaptive Simpson's rule and one using the Romberg rule.

## Prerequisites
- Alveo card (eg U200) installed and configured as per https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u200.html#gettingStarted
- Xilinx runtime (XRT) installed
- Xilinx Vitis 2020.1 installed and configured

## Building the Test
The demonstration application and kernel is built using a command line Makefile flow.

### Step 1 :
Setup the build environment using the Vitis and XRT scripts:

            source <install path>/Vitis/2020.1/settings64.sh
            source /opt/xilinx/xrt/setup.sh

### Step 2 :
Call the Makefile. For example:

	make check TARGET=hw_emu PLATFORMS=xilinx_u200_xdma_201830_2
        

The Makefile supports hardware emulation and hardware targets ('hw_emu' and 'hw', respectively).  




If the make check option is used the demo will automatically be lauched.
