Features of AMD Vitis |trade| Ultrasound Library 
=================================================

   :maxdepth: 1

Before 23.2 release, the provided toolbox-style APIs focus on providing extreme performance but rely on many PL modules for sub-graph connection and parameter generation. In 23.2 release, the library provides an all-in-AIE scanline implementation. Thus, you can not only combinate algorithms in bottom-to-top way by using toolbox-style APIs, but also start from the all-in-AIE scanline implementation to obtain the final design by modifying some graphs.

A set of C-models of scanline are provided that can be seen as a step-by-step flow from algorithm-end to AIE-end. The C-model functions can also be used to generate input and verify output simultaneously and conveniently. 

Code structures enhancement
----------------------------

- L1: all L1 BLAS kernel APIs (toolbox) files locate in separated directories with their orinal name.
- L1: all L1 algorithm kernel APIs (all-in-AIE) files locate in separated directories beginning with "kernel_."
- L2: all L2 ultrasound toolbox graph APIs are shareing global settings from "L1/include/kernels.hpp."
- L2: all L2 ultrasound all-in-AIE graph APIs beginning with "graph_" are shareing global settings from "L1/include/kernel_*.hpp."
- L3: all 4 L3 example (Scanline_AllinAIE/PW/SA/Scanline) are located in separated directory under "L3/tests", each contains self contain data and source code.
- L3: the scanline algorithm C-models are located in separated directory under "L3/models."

For L2/L3 cases, source code for differenct device are well orgnized. The structure is showed as bellow:

.. code-block:: txt

   aie_graph:     aie graph define
   PL_kernels:    HLS C/C++ code for PL kernels 
   PS_host:       XRT based host code for VCK190
   data:          input data & output golden data
   system.cfg:    hw platform descriptions

Host code enhancement
---------------------

For L2/L3 cases, XRT based PS host code are provided in each directory of "<path_to_apis>/PS_host/". The host code read input simulation data and call on aie graph by 1 run and also evoke PL kernels of "mm2s" and "s2mm" for PL side data input/output. The results are compared to "data/golden" for verify the design.
 
Support for AIE full verification flow on VCK190 platform
-----------------------------------------------------------

This library provides the detailed example for full aie design/verification flow, which contains x86sim/aiesim/hw_emu/hw. The testbench support "make run TARGET=*" from basic functional verification to final hw performance test, and also contain golden file check. Users could check performance or functional correctness through each of the verification depth, in this toolbox library for vck190 based aie design.
