**********************************
QR Decomposition with Householder
**********************************

Introduction
==============

This function computes the QR decomposition of matrix :math:`A` based on householder algorithm.

.. math::
    A = Q R

where :math:`A` is a matrix of size :math:`m \times n` with `m >= n`, :math:`Q` is orthogonal matrix of size :math:`m \times m`, and :math:`R` is an upper triangular matrix with zero rows from the (n+1)-st row, the size of matrix R is :math:`m \times n`. 
If matirx A is a complex square matrix, then there is a decomposition A = QR where Q is a unitary matrix.
The Householder method: Apply a succession of orthogonal matrices :math:`Q_k` to :math: `A` to compute upper triangular matrix R. :math:`Q_k` introduces zeros below the diagonal in column k, while preserving all the zeros previously introduced. 

.. math::
    * Q_N*...*Q_2*Q_1 * A = R

.. math::
    * conjugate_transpose(Q) = Q_N* ...*Q_2*Q_1

Entry Point 
==============

The graph entry point is the following:

Design Notes
--------------------
* Target: :math:`A=QR`, :math:`A[M*N]` is input matrix, :math:`Q[M*M]` is orthogonal matrix and  :math:`R[M*N]` is an upper trapezoidal matrix. 
* DataType supported: `cfloat`.
* DataSize supported: input matrix size :math:`M` is the times of 4 and no bigger than 512, and :math:`N` shoulb be no bigger than 256.
* Description: 
    * For single AIE core, AIE core function calculate the reflection vector in column k, and then update the rest of elements of :math:`matA` and update orthogonal matrix math:`matQ` using the reflection vector.
    * For the whole design, :math:`N` AIE cores are used, :math:`N` is the number of input matrix's column number. The reason is that zeros below diagonal is introduced column by column.
    * The previous core's output is fed to the next core's input, and on and on, till the last column is computed;
* Implementation Notes:
    * This design utilzied "HouseHolder" method to solve QR decomposition.
    * This design takes two streams as input interface and two streams as output interface.
    * It takes input of matrix A and matrix I (identity matrix) as inputs, and generate matrix Q and R as output.
    * Matrix A and I are concated in row to form a (m+n) rows x (n) columns matrix, so Elements[0:M-1] of each column are from A and Elements[M:M+N-1] are from I.
    * Matrix Q and R are concated in row to form a (m+n) rows x (n) columns matrix, so Elements[0:M-1] of each column are from Q and Elements[M:M+N-1] are from R.
    * Concated inputs are injected column by column, concated outputs are extracted in the same way.
    * Each column of inputs are injected to two input stream in such way: Elem[N*4] and Elem[N*4+1] to stream 0, Elem[N*4+2], Elem[N*4+3] to stream 1.
    * Each column of outputs are extracted in the same way as inputs, but from output stream 0 and 1.

Graph Interfaces
--------------------

.. code::

   template <int M, int N>
   void qrd_householder(input_stream<cfloat>* __restrict matAU_0,
                        input_stream<cfloat>* __restrict matAU_1,
                        output_stream<cfloat>* __restrict matRQ_0,
                        output_stream<cfloat>* __restrict matRQ_1,
                        const int column_id);

.. note::

   * To utilize bandwidth of input / output stream, the input matrix and output result are transfered in such way: Elem[N*4] and Elem[N*4+1] are transferred with matAU_0/matRQ_0, Elem[N*4+2] and Elem[N*4+3] are transferred with matAU_1/matRQ_1. 


* Input:

  *  ``input_stream<cfloat>* matAU_0``    stream of input matrix, contains lower two elements of each 4 elements.
  *  ``input_stream<cfloat>* matAU_1``    stream of input matrix, contains higher two elements of each 4 elements.
  *  ``column_id``                        column id, the elements below diagonal will be zeroed.

* Output:

  *  ``input_stream<cfloat>* matRQ_0``    stream of output matrix, contains lower two elements of each 4 elements.
  *  ``input_stream<cfloat>* matRQ_1``    stream of output matrix, contains higher two elements of each 4 elements.
