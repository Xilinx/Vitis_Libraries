Release Note
============

   :maxdepth: 1

Motor Control Library is an open-sourced library written in C/C++ for accelerating developments of motor control applications. It now covers four algorithm-level L1 APIs including FOC, SVPWM_DUTY, PWM_GEN, and QEI. Operator-level APIs, such as Clarke transform and its inverse transform, Park transform and its inverse transform, and PID are also implemented.

2025.1
-------

In 2025.1 release, a new version of PWM, IP_PWM_V2, is provided, which is a new implementation of the PWM generation algorithm. And the IP_VOLTAGE_MODULATION is also updated to support the new PWM generation algorithm.

2024.2
-------

In 2024.2 release, 12 new fine-grained function-level APIs are provided for lower level utilization. These APIs include angle_generation, Clarke_Direct, Clarke_Inverse, demuxer_pi, ps_iir_filter, muxer_pi, Park_Direct, Park_Inverse, PI_Control, PI_Control_stream, SVPWM and voltage_modulation. And from 24.2 release, the L1/test/IP_FOC functionally becomes a register container module for managing all the asynchronous control parameters.

2023.2
-------

In 2023.2 release, the sensor-based FOC IP has been updated by adding a new control mode 'MOD_MANUAL_TORQUE_FLUX_FIXED_ANGLE'.

2023.1
-------

The 2023.1 release covers a range of key algorithms, includes:

1. FOC: The API is for sensor based field-orientated control (FOC).From 2024.2 release, the L1/test/IP_FOC functionally becomes a register container module which can be composed by the 12 new-added fine-grained function-level APIs.
2. SVPWM_DUTY: The API is the front-end for Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM) to calculate ratios.
3. PWM_GEN: The API is the back-end for Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM) to generate output signals based on ratios.
4. QEI: The API is for quadrature encoder interface(QEI).
