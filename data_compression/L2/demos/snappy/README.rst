===========================================
AMD Snappy Compression and Decompression
===========================================

The Snappy example resides in the ``L2/demos/snappy`` directory. 

AMD Snappy compression/decompression is a FPGA based implementation of standard Snappy. The AMD implementation of Snappy application is aimed at achieving high throughput for both compression and decompression. This AMD Snappy application is developed and tested on the AMD Alveo™ U200. To learn more about the standard Snappy application, refer https://github.com/google/snappy.

This application is accelerated using generic hardware architecture for LZ based data compression algorithms.

Performance Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table presents the kernel throughput achieved with a single compute unit during execution of this application.

============================= =========================
Topic                         Results
============================= =========================
Compression Throughput        1.8 Gb/s
Decompression Throughput      1 Gb/s
Average Compression Ratio     2.14x (Silesia Benchmark)
============================= =========================

.. note:: The overall throughput can still be increased with multiple compute units.

Software and Hardware
-------------------

::

     Software: AMD Vitis 2022.2
     Hardware: xilinx_u200_gen3x16_xdma_1_202110_1 (Xilinx Alveo U200)

Usage
-----

Build Steps
~~~~~~~~~~~

Emulation Flows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

     make run TARGET=hw_emu PLATFORM=xilinx_u200_gen3x16_xdma_1_202110_1
     
     Note: This command compiles for the targeted emulation mode and executes the
           application.

Hardware
^^^^^^^^

::

     make all TARGET=hw PLATFORM=xilinx_u200_gen3x16_xdma_1_202110_1

     Note: This command compiles for hardware execution. It generates the kernel binary ".xclbin" file. 
           This file is placed in the ./build/xclbin*/ directory under the Snappy folder.

Executable Usage
----------------
 
1. To execute single file for compression: ``./build_dir.<TARGET mode>.<xsa_name>/xil_snappy -xbin ./build_dir.<TARGET mode>.<xsa_name>/<compress_decompress.xclbin> -c <file_name>``
2. To execute single file for decompression: ``./build_dir.<TARGET mode>.<xsa_name>/xil_snappy -xbin ./build_dir.<TARGET mode>.<xsa_name>/<compress_decompress.xclbin> -d <file_name.snappy>``
3. To validate single file (compress & decompress): ``./build_dir.<TARGET mode>.<xsa_name>/xil_snappy -xbin ./build_dir.<TARGET mode>.<xsa_name>/<compress_decompress.xclbin> -t <file_name>``
4. To execute multiple files for compression: ``./build_dir.<TARGET mode>.<xsa_name>/xil_snappy -xbin ./build_dir.<TARGET mode>.<xsa_name>/<compress_decompress.xclbin> -cfl <files.list>``
5. To execute multiple files for decompression: ``./build_dir.<TARGET mode>.<xsa_name>/xil_snappy -xbin ./build_dir.<TARGET mode>.<xsa_name>/<compress_decompress.xclbin> -dfl <compressed files.list>``
6. To validate multiple files (compress and decompress): ``./build_dir.<TARGET mode>.<xsa_name>/xil_snappy -xbin ./build_dir.<TARGET mode>.<xsa_name>/<compress_decompress.xclbin> -l <files.list>``  
               
      - ``<files.list>``: Contains various file names with the current path.

      - Note: Default arguments are set in the Makefile.

The usage of the generated executable is as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

          --help,                -h        Print Help Options
          --compress,            -c        Compress
          --decompress,          -d        Decompress
          --test,                -t        Compress & Decompress
          --compress_list,       -cfl      Compress List of Input Files
          --decompress_list,     -dfl      Decompress List of compressed Input Files
          --test_list,           -l        Compress & Decompress on Input Files
