hmacSha1
========

To profile performance of hmacSha1, we prepare a datapack of 512K messages, each message is 1Kbyte,
key length is 256bits. We have 4 kernels, each kernel has 16 PUs.
Kernel utilization and throughput is shown in table below.

Executable Usage
================

* **Work Directory(Step 1)**

The steps for library download and environment setup can be found in :ref:`l1_vitis_security`. For getting the design,

```
   cd L1/benchmarks/hmacSha1
```

* **Build kernel(Step 2)**

Run the following make command to build your XCLBIN and host binary targeting a specific device. Please be noticed that this process will take a long time, maybe couple of hours.

```
   source /opt/xilinx/Vitis/2022.2/settings64.sh
   source /opt/xilinx/xrt/setenv.sh
   export PLATFORM=u50_gen3x16
   export TARGET=hw
   make run 
```

* **Run kernel(Step 3)**

To get the benchmark results, please run the following command.

```
   ./BUILD_DIR/host.exe -xclbin ./BUILD_DIR/hmacSha1Kernel.xclbin -data PROJECT/data/test.dat -num 16
```

Input Arguments:

```
   Usage: host.exe -[-xclbin]
          -xclbin     binary;
```

* **Example output(Step 4)**

```

Profiling 
=========

The hmacSha1 is validated on Xilinx Alveo U250 board. 
Its resource, frequency and throughput is shown as below.
