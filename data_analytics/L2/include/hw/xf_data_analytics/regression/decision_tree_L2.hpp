 * @brief Decision Tree Train enviroment context struct
 *
 * Note that the structure are used in both host and kernel
 *
 * As shown in the struct, there are 8 memebers.
 * 1. cretiea is the algorithm to compute node impurity and information gain
 *    0 : gini impurity(support)
 *    1 : entropy (not support)
 *    2 : Variance (not support)
 * 2. min_leaf_size A node stops splitting when it receives the number of training instances
 * 3. max_tree_depth is user input value in host, not transfer to device.
 * 4. (for extension) maxBins determines the max splits of each feature.
 *    in current version, splits are read from configuration.
 *    The parameter is for splits generation extension
 * 5. (for extension) min_samplecount_for_sample, for random forest and split generation sampling
 * 6. (for extension) sample_percent_if_sample, for random forest and split generation sampling
 * 7. (for extension) min_info_gain For entropy extension, a node stops splitting when its max gain <= this value
