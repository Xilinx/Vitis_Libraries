# Vitis Project for TPC-H Q5

## Overview

This project demostrate FPGA acceleration of TPC-H Q5 on scale factor 1 data.

```

## Running the Benchmark

Usage can be queried with `make help`. Basic use is:

```
make run TARGET=hw_emu PLATFORM=/path/to/xpfm
```

`hw_emu` is used to to run RTL simulation, change `hw` to `hw_emu` to run board test.


## Dataset

We used the TPC-H dataset generated with ssb-dbgen tool.
The host binary will download the tool and create data files in the same folder as itself.
