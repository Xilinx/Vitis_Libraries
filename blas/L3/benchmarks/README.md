# Benchmark Test Overview

Here are benchmarks of the Vitis BLAS library using the Vitis environment and comparing with Intel Math Kernel Library. It supports hardware emulation as well as running hardware accelerators on the Alveo U250.

## Prerequisites

### Vitis BLAS Library
- Alveo U250 installed and configured as per https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u250.html#gettingStarted (when running hardware)
- Xilinx runtime (XRT) installed
- Xilinx Vitis 2025.1 installed and configured

### Interl MK Library
- Downloaded and installed MKL from https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl/choose-download/linux 

## Benchmark with CPU

### Step 1 :

Setup and build envrionment using MKL scripts:

```
    source <INTEL_MKL_INSTALL_DIR>/bin/mklvars.sh intel64
```

### Step 2 :
 
Run Makefile command. For example:

```
    cd gemm_mkl
    ./run_gemm_mkl.sh 16 float b
```

## Building and run the kernel with Vitis

Taken gemm/memKernel as an example to indicate how to build the application and kernel with the command line Makefile flow.

### Download code

These blas benchmarks can be downloaded from [vitis libraries](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis_Libraries.git) ``main`` branch.

```
   git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis_Libraries.git
   cd Vitis_Libraries
   git checkout main
   cd blas
```

### Setup environment :

Setup and build envrionment using the Vitis and XRT scripts:

```
    source <install path>/Vitis/2025.1/settings64.sh
    source /opt/xilinx/xrt/setup.sh
```

### Build and run the kernel :

Run Makefile command. For example:

```
    make run TARGET=hw PLATFORM_REPO_PATHS=/opt/xilinx/platforms PLATFORM=xilinx_u250_gen3x16_xdma_4_1_202210_1
```

The Makefile supports various build target including hw emulation and hardware (hw_emu, hw)

The host application could be run manually using the following pattern:

```
    <host application> <xclbin> <argv>
```

For example:

```
    build_dir.hw.xilinx_u250_gen3x16_xdma_4_1_202210_1/host.exe build_dir.hw.xilinx_u250_gen3x16_xdma_4_1_202210_1/blas.xclbin build_dir.hw.xilinx_u250_gen3x16_xdma_4_1_202210_1/config_info.dat
```
