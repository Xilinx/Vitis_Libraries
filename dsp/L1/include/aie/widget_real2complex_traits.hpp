Single Rate Asymetrical FIR traits.
This file contains sets of overloaded, templatized and specialized templatized functions which
encapsulate properties of the intrinsics used by the main kernal class. Specifically,
this file does not contain any vector types or intrinsics since it is required for construction
and therefore must be suitable for the aie compiler graph-level compilation.
