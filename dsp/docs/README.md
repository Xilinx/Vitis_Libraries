Document Source Code
=========================

## Generating HTML Document

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables must be set before using the Makefile
to compile the document:

+ **HTML_DEST_DIR** points to the directory in which the HTML will be
  installed to.
+ **PATH** should include directory of `doxyrest` binary.

### Makefile targets

The top Makefile contains the following targets, each depending on the previous
one.

+ **xml**: call `doxygen` to extract the inline doc from C++ headers.
+ **rst**: call `doxyrest` to yield reStructuredText files from XML files.
+ **html**: call `sphinx` to generate HTML from generated reStructuredText
  files and manually written ones.
+ **install**: copy the HTML files to `$HTML_DEST_DIR`.
