.. _FIR_TDM:

=======
FIR TDM
=======

The DSPLib contains a Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM) variant of finite impulse response (FIR) filter.
It is a multi-channel FIR filter with configurable application parameters, e.g. number of channels, FIR length, as well as implementation parameters, e.g. IO buffer size or super sample rate (SSR) operation mode.

.. _FIR_TDM_ENTRY:

Entry Point
===========

TDM FIR have been placed in a distinct namespace scope: ``xf::dsp::aie::fir::tdm``.

The graph entry point is the following:

.. code-block::

    xf::dsp::aie::fir::tdm::fir_tdm_graph

Device Support
==============

The TDM FIR filter supports both AIE and AIE-ML devices for all features with the following exceptions:

- The ``cfloat`` data type is not supported on AIE-ML device
- Round modes available and the enumerated values of round modes differ between AIE and AIE-ML devices. See :ref:`COMPILING_AND_SIMULATING`.

Supported Types
===============

TDM FIR filters can be configured for various types of data and coefficients. These types can be int16, int32, or float, and also real or complex. Certain combinations of data and coefficient type are not supported.

The following table lists the supported combinations of data type and coefficient type with notes for those combinations not supported.

Design Notes
============

.. _COEFFS_FOR_FIR_TDM:

Coefficient Array for Filters
-----------------------------

The coefficient array values are passed as an array argument to the constructor as either a single dimension ``std::array`` or a ``std::vector``.

Coefficients - Array Size
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TDM FIR Coefficient array size is equal to the length of the FIR multiplied by number of channels, i.e.:

``Coeff_Array_Size = TP_FIR_LEN * TP_TDM_CHANNELS``

.. _FIR_TDM_COEFF_ORGANIZATION:

Coefficients - Array Organization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Coefficient vector must be created in a form that lists set of taps for each channel at a time as an argument to the constructor in the following form:

.. code-block::

   std::vector<TT_COEFF> coeffVector = {
                                 C0.0, C0.1, C0.2, C0.3, ..., C0.M-2, C0.M-1,
                                 C1.0, C1.1, C1.2, C1.3, ..., C1.M-2, C1.M-1,
                                 C2.0, C2.1, C2.2, C2.3, ..., C2.M-2, C2.M-1,
                                 ...
                                 CN-2.0, CN-2.1, CN-2.2, CN-2.3, ..., CN-2.M-2, CN-2.M-1,
                                 CN-1.0, CN-1.1, CN-1.2, CN-1.3, ..., CN-1.M-2, CN-1.M-1,
                                 };

where:

- TT_COEFF - coefficient type, e.g. ``int16``,
- N - FIR Length, i.e. number of taps on each channel (``TP_FIR_LEN``),
- M - Number of TDM Channels  (``TP_TDM_CHANNELS``).

.. _BUFFER_API_FIRS:

IO Buffer Interface for Filters
-------------------------------

On the AI Engine processor, data can be packetized into IO buffers, which are mapped to the local memory.

IO buffers can be accessed with a 256-bit wide load/store operation, hence offering a throughput of up to 256 Gb/s (based on 1 GHz AI Engine clock).

IO buffers are implemented using a `ping-pong` mechanism, where the consumer kernel would read the `ping` portion of the buffer while the producer would fill the `pong` portion of the buffer that would be consumed in the next iteration.

In each iteration run, the kernel operates on a set number of samples from the input buffer, defined by the template parameter ``TP_INPUT_WINDOW_VSIZE``. To allow the kernel to safely operate on buffered data, a mechanism of lock acquires and releases is implemented.

Margin
^^^^^^

Input buffer of a TDM FIR may be extended by a margin so that the state of the filter at the end of the previous iteration can be restored.

Amount of margin required by TDM FIR can be calculated using formula:

``Margin_samples = (TP_FIR_LEN - 1) * TP_TDM_CHANNELS``

Internal Margin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For cases where margin data exceeds new arriving data, i.e. when
``Margin_samples > TP_INPUT_WINDOW_VSIZE``
margin will be implemented as a separate buffer, internal to the kernel that operates on it.

As a result, the input buffers will not be extended by margin data.

.. note:: Internal Margin handling is not supported on AIE-ML device.

Maximizing Throughput
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Buffer synchronization requirements introduce a fixed overhead when a kernel is triggered.
Therefore, to maximize throughput, the input buffer size should be set to the maximum that the system will allow.

.. note:: To achieve maximum performance, the producer and consumer kernels should be placed in adjacent AI Engine tiles, so the window buffers can be accessed without a requirement for a MM2S/S2MM direct memory access (DMA) stream conversions.

Multiple Frames
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To minimize kernel switching overheads and therefore, maximize performance, TDM FIR supports batching multiple frames into a single input buffer.
A frame can defined as a set of data samples, one data sample for each TDM channel, i.e. a frame is a set of ``TP_TDM_CHANNELS`` input samples.

Input buffer size can be set to an integer multiple of TDM Channels, e.g.:
``TP_INPUT_WINDOW_VSIZE = TP_TDM_CHANNELS * NUMBER_OF_FRAMES``

A TDM FIR configured to operate on multiple frames in a given kernel iteration will produce equal amount of output frames.

Latency
^^^^^^^

Latency of a buffer-based TDM FIR is predominantly due to the buffering in the input and output buffers. Other factors which affect latency are data and coefficient types and FIR length, though these tend to have a lesser effect.

To minimize the latency, the buffer size should be set to the minimum size that meets the required throughput.

.. _FIR_TDM_MAX_WINDOW_SIZE:

Maximum Window Size
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Window buffer is mapped into a local memory in the area surrounding the kernel that accesses it.

A local memory storage is 32 kB (64 kB for AIE-ML devices), and the maximum size of the `ping-pong` window buffer should not exceed this limit.

.. note:: Input buffers may be extended by margin data, which can significantly reduce the maximum window size.


.. _FIR_TDM_SINGLE_BUFFER_CONSTRAINT:

Single Buffer Constraint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| It is possible to disable the `ping-pong` mechanism, so that the entire available data memory is available to the kernel for computation. However, the single-buffered window can be accessed only by one agent at a time, and it comes with a performance penalty.
| This can be achieved by using the `single_buffer()` constraint that is applied to an input or output port of each kernel.

.. code-block::

    single_buffer(firGraph.getKernels()[0].in[0]);

.. _FIR_TDM_INPUT_ORGANIZATION:

Input Data Samples - Array Organization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Input Data Samples must be stored in the Input Buffer in a form that lists set of input samples for each channel at a time, i.e. in the following form:

.. code-block::

   std::vector<TT_DATA> dataVector = {
                                 D0.0, D0.1, D0.2, D0.2, ..., D0.M-2, D0.M-1,
                                 D1.0, D1.1, D1.2, D1.2, ..., D1.M-2, D1.M-1,
                                 ...
                                 DF-2.0, DF-2.1, DF-2.2, DF-2.2, ..., DF-2.M-2, DF-2.M-1,
                                 DF-1.0, DF-1.1, DF-1.2, DF-1.2, ..., DF-1.M-2, DF-1.M-1,
                                 };

where:

- TT_DATA - data type, e.g. ``cint16``,
- M - Number of TDM Channels  (``TP_TDM_CHANNELS``),
- F - Number of Frames within Input Buffer   (``NUMBER_OF_FRAMES = TP_INPUT_WINDOW_VSIZE / TP_TDM_CHANNELS``).

Streaming Interface for Filters
-------------------------------

Streaming interfaces are not supported by TDM FIR.

Cascaded kernels
----------------

Cascade - Operation Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TDM FIR can be configured to operate on multiple cascaded AI Engine Tiles using ``TP_CASC_LEN`` template parameter.

When used (``TP_CASC_LEN > 1``), an array of ``TP_CASC_LEN`` kernels will be created and connected through cascade interface. Each kernel will operate on a fraction of the ``TP_FIR_LEN`` requested (``TP_FIR_LEN / TP_CASC_LEN``).

FIR taps will be split in a balanced way that ensures maximum efficiency of the cascaded chain.

For example, a 16 tap FIR split over 2 cascaded kernels will result in each operating on 8 taps, while cascade of 3 will result in kernels operating on 6 taps on first kernel and 5 taps on remaining kernels.


Cascade - Resource Utilization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The number of AI Engine tiles used by a TDM FIR will be an integer multiple of ``TP_CASC_LEN``.

Cascade - Port Utilization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Configuring TDM FIR into a chain of cascaded kernels (``TP_CASC_LEN > 1``) does not affect Input and Output ports.


Output type
-----------

TDM FIR graph class allows to specify 32-bit output type when input type is 16-bit using template parameter ``TT_OUT_DATA``.


.. _FIR_TDM_SSR_OPERATION:

Super Sample Rate
-----------------

The term Super Sample Rate strictly means the processing of more than one sample per clock cycle. Because the AI Engine is a vector processor, almost every operation is SSR by this definition, making it superfluous. Therefore, in the AI Engine context, SSR is taken to mean an implementation using multiple computation paths to improve performance at the expense of additional resource use.

.. _FIR_TDM_SSR_OPERATION_MODE:

Super Sample Rate - Operation Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TDM FIR can be configured to operate in SSR Mode using ``TP_SSR`` template parameter.  The mode will create an array of ``TP_SSR`` kernels and create the ``TP_SSR`` amount of the **input** and **output** ports.

When SSR mode is use, i.e. when ``TP_SSR > 1``, Input Samples, and therefore, corresponding TDM Channels will be split over multiple parallel paths.

As a result, each SSR path will operate on a fraction of the workload, i.e. each path will operate on ``TP_TDM_CHANNELS / TP_SSR`` number of TDM Channels.

Input data samples are distributed across the input paths in a round-robin, sample-by-sample mechanism where each input path processes a fraction of the input samples, i.e. ``TP_INPUT_WINDOW_VSIZE / TP_SSR``. More details in: :ref:`FIR_TDM_SSR_PORT_MAPPING`.


.. _FIR_TDM_SSR_OPERATION_RESOURCE_UTILIZATION:

Super Sample Rate - Resource Utilization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The number of AI Engine tiles used by a TDM FIR will be given by the formula:

.. code-block::

  NUMBER_OF_AIE_TILES = TP_SSR x TP_CASC_LEN

TDM FIR graph will split the requested FIR workload among the FIR kernels equally, which can mean that each kernel is tasked with a comparatively low computational effort.


.. _FIR_TDM_SSR_OPERATION_PORT_UTILIZATION:

Super Sample Rate - Port Utilization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The number of input/output ports created by a FIR will be given by the formula:

* Number of input ports: ``NUM_INPUT_PORTS  = TP_SSR``

* Number of output ports: ``NUM_OUTPUT_PORTS  = TP_SSR``

.. _FIR_TDM_SSR_PORT_MAPPING:

Super Sample Rate - Sample to Port Mapping
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a Super Sample Rate operation is used, data is input and output using multiple ports.

The input data channel must be split over multiple ports where each successive input sample is sent to a different input port in a round-robin fashion, i.e., sample 0 goes to input port :code:`in[0]`, sample 1 to :code:`in[1]`, etc. up to ``N-1`` where ``N = TP_SSR``, then sample N goes to :code:`in[0]`, sample N+1 goes to :code:`in[1]` and so on. Output samples are output from the multiple output ports in the same fashion.

For example, for a data stream that looks like:  :code:`int32 x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ...`, with an SSR parameter set to 3, input samples should be split accordingly:

.. code-block::

  in[0] = 0, 3, 6, 9,  12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, ...
  in[1] = 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 37, 40, 43, 46, ...
  in[2] = 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35, 38, 41, 44, 47, ...

The output data will be produced in a similar method.

.. _FIR_TDM_CONSTRAINTS:

Constraints
-----------

TDM FIR variant has a variety of access methods to help assign a constraint on a kernel and/or a net, e.g.:

- `getKernels()` which returns a pointer to an array of kernel pointers, or

More details are provided in the :ref:`API_REFERENCE`.

An example of how to use this is given in the section :ref:`FIR_TDM_CODE_EXAMPLE`.

.. _FIR_TDM_CODE_EXAMPLE:
