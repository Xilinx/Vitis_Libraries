.. _FFT_2D:

============
FFT IFFT 2D
============

This library element implements a 2D FFT/IFFT function. It has configurable point sizes, data types, and
sizes separately for the two dimensions. It also has a configurable twiddle type, rounding and saturation modes, scaling (as a shift), cascade length, and twiddle mode.

Entry Point
===========

The graph entry point is the following:

.. code-block::

    xf::dsp::aie::fft::two_d::fft_ifft_2d_graph

Device Support
==============

The 2D FFT/IFFT supports AIE-ML devices only.


Supported Types
===============

The input data types to the 2D FFT are controlled by the ``TT_DATA_D1`` and ``TT_DATA_D2`` template parameters, see :ref:`API_REFERENCE`.

Template Parameters
===================

To see details on the template parameters for the 2D FFT/IFFT, see :ref:`API_REFERENCE`.

Access Functions
================

To see details on the access functions for the 2D FFT/IFFT, see :ref:`API_REFERENCE`.

Ports
=====
To see details on the ports for the 2D FFT/IFFT, see :ref:`API_REFERENCE`.
