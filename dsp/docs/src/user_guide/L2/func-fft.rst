.. _FFT_IFFT:

========
FFT/iFFT
========

The DSPLib contains two different FFT/iFFT solutions. The first AI Engine-only implementation is recommended for point sizes less than or equal to 4096, or for configurations which do not require Super Sample Rate performance. The second AI Engine + PL implementation is recommended for larger point sizes and Super Sample Rate performance. While both support super-sample-rate, the AI Engine+PL uses resources more efficiently.
