.. _FILTERS:

=======
Filters
=======

The DSPLib contains several variants of finite impulse response (FIR) filters. These include single-rate FIRs, half-band interpolation/decimation FIRs, as well as integer and fractional interpolation/decimation FIRs.

.. _FILTER_ENTRY:

Entry Point
===========

FIR filters have been categorized into classes and placed in a distinct namespace scope: ``xf::dsp::aie::fir``, to prevent name collision in the global scope. Namespace aliasing can be utilized to shorten instantiations:

.. code-block::

    namespace dsplib = xf::dsp::aie;

Additionally, each FIR filter has been placed in its unique FIR type namespace. The available FIR filter classes and the corresponding graph entry point are listed as follows:

The FIR filters support AIE, AIE-ML and AIE-MLv2 for all features with the following exceptions:

- The ``cfloat`` data type is not supported on AIE-ML device
- Round modes available and the enumerated values of round modes are the same for AIE-ML and AIE-MLv2 devices, but differ from those for AIE devices. See :ref:`COMPILING_AND_SIMULATING`.

Design Notes

.. _COEFFS_FOR_FIRS:

Coefficient Array for Filters
-----------------------------

Static Coefficients
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For all non-reloadable filter configurations, the coefficient values are passed as an array argument to the constructor as either a std::array or std::vector.

Static Coefficients - Array Size
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Asymmetrical FIR**

| Asymmetrical filters expect the port to contain the full array of coefficients, i.e., the coefficient array size is equal to the ``TP_FIR_LEN``.
| The length of the array expected will therefore be ``(TP_FIR_LEN``, e.g., for a filter of length 7, where coefficients are ``int16``:
| ``{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}``, the constructor expects an argument:
| ``std::array<int16, 7> tapsIn =  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}``.

**Symmetrical FIR**

| In the case of symmetrical filters, only the first half (plus any odd center tap) need be passed, as the remaining might be derived by symmetry.
| The length of the array expected will therefore be ``(TP_FIR_LEN+1)/2``, e.g., for a filter of length 7, where coefficients are ``int16``:
| ``{1, 2, 3, 5, 3, 2, 1}``, four non-zero tap values, including the center tap, are expected, i.e., the constructor expects an argument:
| ``std::array<int16, 4> tapsIn =  {1, 2, 3, 5}``.

**Half-band FIR**

| For half-band filters, only the non-zero coefficients should be entered with the center tap last in the array.
| The length of the array expected will therefore be ``(TP_FIR_LEN+1)/4+1``, e.g., for a half-band filter of length 7, where coefficients are:
| ``{1, 0, 2, 5, 2, 0, 1}``, three non-zero tap values, including the center tap, are expected, i.e., constructor expects an argument:
| ``std::array<int16, 3> tapsIn =  {1, 2, 5}``.

Reloadable Coefficients
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Reloadable coefficients are available through the use of a runtime programmable (RTP) Asynchronous input port, programmed by the processor subsystem (PS) at runtime.
Reloadable configurations do not require the coefficient array to be passed to the constructor at compile time.
Instead, the graph's `update()` (refer to `UG1079 Run-Time Parameter Update/Read Mechanisms <https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/ug1079-ai-engine-kernel-coding/Run-Time-Parameter-Update/Read-Mechanisms>`_ for usage instructions) method is used to input the coefficient array.
Graph's `update()` method takes an argument of either scalar or an array type.
Please refer to `UG1079 Run-Time Parameter Support Summary <https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/ug1079-ai-engine-kernel-coding/Run-Time-Parameter-Support-Summary>`_.

.. note:: Graph's `update()` method must be called after graph has been initialized, but before kernel starts operation on data samples.

.. note:: SSR configurations don't offer support for symmetry. Therefore, RTP array size should be determined using: :ref:`RTP_ARRAY_SIZE_FOR_SSR_CASES`.

.. note:: AIE-ML and AIE-MLv2 devices do not offer HW support for symmetry. Therefore, RTP array size should be determined using:  :ref:`RTP_ARRAY_SIZE_FOR_SSR_CASES`.

.. _RTP_ARRAY_SIZE_FOR_NON_SSR_CASES:

Reloadable Coefficients - Array Size for Non-SSR Cases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Array size of an argument passed to the graph's `update()` method depends on the FIR variant type, as well as the operational mode the FIR is configured to run.

| In case the FIR is configured in a non-SSR mode, i.e., ``TP_SSR`` is set to 1, the reloadable coefficient array size is similar to the static coefficient variant.

**Asymmetrical* FIR**

| Asymmetrical filters expect the port to contain the full array of coefficients, i.e., the coefficient array size is equal to the ``TP_FIR_LEN``,
| e.g., for a filter of length 7, where ``int16`` type coefficient's values are:
| ``{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}``, the graph's `update()` method expects an argument:
| ``int16 tapsIn =  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}``.

**Symmetrical FIR**

| In the case of symmetrical (non-half-band) filters, only the first half (plus any odd center tap) need be passed, as the remaining can be derived by symmetry.
| The length of the array expected will therefore be ``(TP_FIR_LEN+1)/2``,
| e.g., for a filter of length 7, where ``int16`` type coefficient's values are:
|  ``{1, 2, 3, 5, 3, 2, 1}``,
| four non-zero tap values, including the center tap are expected, i.e., the graph's `update()` method expects an argument:
| ``int16 tapsIn[4] =  {1, 2, 3, 5}``.

**Half-band FIR**

| For half-band filters, only the non-zero coefficients should be entered, with the center tap last in the array.
| The length of the array expected will therefore be ``(TP_FIR_LEN+1)/4+1``,
| e.g., for a half-band filter of length 7, where ``int16`` type coefficient's values are:
| ``{1, 0, 2, 5, 2, 0, 1}``,
| three non-zero tap values, including the center tap are expected, i.e., the graph's `update()` method expects an argument:
| ``int16 tapsIn[3] =  {1, 2, 5}``.

.. _RTP_ARRAY_SIZE_FOR_SSR_CASES:

Reloadable Coefficients - Array Dimensions for SSR Cases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Reloadable coefficients are also available for Super Sample Rate (SSR) modes of operation. For more details on SSR, refer to: :ref:`SSR_OPERATION`.
When the FIR is configured in an SSR mode that creates multiple parallel computation paths, i.e., ``TP_SSR`` or ``TP_PARA_INTERP_POLY`` is greater than 1, the graph will be created with an array of RTP input ports.

.. note:: The size of the RTP input port array is equal to the total number of parallel computation paths, defined by: ``TP_SSR * TP_PARA_INTERP_POLY``.

| Each port should contain the same taps array content, i.e., each additional port must be a duplicate of the complete coefficient array.
| This is a necessary step to connect a RTP port to each of otherwise unrelated output computation paths.

.. note:: For example, an interpolation FIR is configured with: ``TP_SSR = 2`` and ``TP_PARA_INTERP_POLY = 3``. Such a configuration will result in ``2 * 3 = 6`` distinct computation paths, which all require an RTP port duplicate.

**Asymmetrical FIR**

As mentioned above, asymmetrical filters expect the port to contain the full array of coefficients, i.e., the coefficient array size is equal to the ``TP_FIR_LEN``.

**Symmetrical FIR**

| In the case of symmetrical filters, the size of each port will be dependent on the underlying kernel structure, which for SSR cases, is based on an Asymmetric FIR variant.
| As a result, deriving the symmetric coefficients from the argument passed to graph's `update()` method is not available.
| The length of the array expected will therefore be ``(TP_FIR_LEN)``,
| e.g., for a filter of length 7, where ``int16`` type coefficient's values are:
| ``{1, 2, 3, 5, 3, 2, 1}``,
| seven non-zero tap values, including the center tap, are expected, i.e., the `update()` method should get an argument:
| ``int16 tapsIn[7] =  {1, 2, 3, 5, 3, 2, 1}``.

| A helper function: ``convert_sym_taps_to_asym`` is provided in the `Graph utils <../../rst/group_graph_utils.html>`_ to ease converting the taps array to the required format.

**Half-band FIR**

| For half-band filters, similarly, the size of each port will be dependent on the underlying kernel structure, which for SSR cases is based on an Asymmetric FIR variant.
| As a result, deriving the symmetric coefficients from the argument passed to graph's `update()` method is not available. However, only the non-zero coefficients should be entered, with the center tap last in the array.
| The length of the array expected will therefore be ``(TP_FIR_LEN+1)/2+1``,
| e.g., for a half-band filter of length 7, where ``int16`` type coefficient's values are:
| ``{1, 0, 2, 5, 2, 0, 1}``,
| three non-zero tap values, including the center tap, are expected, i.e., the `update()` method should get an argument:
| ``int16 tapsIn[5] =  {1, 2, 2, 1, 5}``.

| A helper function: ``convert_hb_taps_to_asym`` is provided in the `Graph utils <../../rst/group_graph_utils.html>`_ to ease converting the taps array to the required format.

.. _WINDOW_API_FIRS:

Window Interface for Filters
-------------------------------

On the AI Engine processor, data can be packetized into window buffers, which are mapped to the local memory.

Window buffers can be accessed with a 256-bit wide load/store operation, hence offering a throughput of up to 256 Gb/s (based on 1 GHz AI Engine clock).

In the case of FIRs, each window is extended by a margin so that the state of the filter at the end of the previous iteration of the window can be restored before the new computations begins.

Window buffers are implemented using a `ping-pong` mechanism, where the consumer kernel would read the `ping` portion of the buffer while the producer would fill the `pong` portion of the buffer that would be consumed in the next iteration.

In each iteration run, the kernel operates on a set number of samples from the window buffer, defined by the template parameter ``TP_INPUT_WINDOW_VSIZE``. To allow the kernel to safely operate on buffered data, a mechanism of lock acquires and releases is implemented.

.. note::  Window interface is not available in Super Sample Rate modes.

**Maximizing Throughput**

Buffer synchronization requirements introduce a fixed overhead when a kernel is triggered.
Therefore, to maximize throughput, the window size should be set to the maximum that the system will allow.

For example, a four tap single-rate symmetric FIR with a `2560` sample input/output window operating on ``int32`` data with ``int16`` implemented on AIE device can produce an output window buffer in `354` clock cycles, which, taking into account kernel's startup overhead (around `40` lock cycles), equates to a throughput of close to `6500 MSa/s` (based on 1 GHz AI Engine clock).

.. note:: To achieve maximum performance, the producer and consumer kernels should be placed in adjacent AI Engine tiles, so the window buffers can be accessed without a requirement for a MM2S/S2MM direct memory access (DMA) stream conversions.

**Latency**

Latency of a window-based FIR is predominantly due to the buffering in the input and output windows. Other factors which affect latency are data and type and FIR length, though these tend to have a lesser effect.

For example, a 16 tap single-rate symmetric FIR with a `512` sample input/output window operating on ``cint16`` data with ``int16`` coefficients implemented on AIE device will need around `2.56 us` (based on 1 GHz AI Engine clock) before the first full window of output samples is available for the consumer to read.
Subsequent iterations will produce output data with reduced latency, due to the nature of the ping-pong buffering and pipelined operations.

To minimize the latency, the buffer size should be set to the minimum size that meets the required throughput.

.. _FIR_MULTIPLE_BUFFER_PORTS:

Multiple Buffer Ports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: AIE-ML and AIE-MLv2 devices only support a single input/output port.

**Multiple Input Ports**

Symmetric FIRs, including half-band FIRs, can be configured with two input buffers. Such an implementation is a trade-off between performance and resource utilization.
Symmetric FIRs with two input ports avoid the potential for memory read contention, which would otherwise result in stall cycles and therefore lower throughput.

Set the ``TP_DUAL_IP`` template parameter to 1, to create a FIR kernel with two input buffer ports.
In this scenario, FIR kernel with two input ports will be created where the FIR kernel expects each buffer to contain an exact copy of the same data.
Both input ports should be connected to the same data source through the FIR's graph.

**Multiple Output Ports**

All FIRs can be configured with two output buffers. Such a design allows greater routing flexibility that offers buffers to be connected directly to downstream components for further processing, avoiding a costly and limiting broadcast with a stream.

Set the ``TP_NUM_OUTPUTS`` template parameter to 2, to create a FIR kernel with two output buffer ports.
In this scenario, two exact copies of output data will be produced in two independent memory buffers.

For example, a single-rate FIR with a `512` input sample buffer will produce two output buffers, where each buffer is `512` samples.

.. _MAX_WINDOW_SIZE:

Maximum Window Size
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Window buffer is mapped into a local memory in the area surrounding the kernel that accesses it.
| A local memory storage is 32 kB (64 kB for AIE-ML and AIE-MLv2 devices), and the maximum size of the `ping-pong` window buffer should not exceed this limit.

.. _SINGLE_BUFFER_CONSTRAINT:

Single Buffer Constraint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| It is possible to disable the `ping-pong` mechanism, so that the entire available data memory is available to the kernel for computation. However, the single-buffered window can be accessed only by one agent at a time, and it comes with a performance penalty.
| This can be achieved by using the `single_buffer()` constraint that is applied to an input or output port of each kernel.

.. code-block::

    single_buffer(firGraph.getKernels()[0].in[0]);

.. _STREAM_API_FIRS:

Streaming Interface for Filters
-------------------------------

Streaming interfaces are now supported by all FIRs. Streaming interfaces are based on 32-bit AXI4-Stream and offer throughput of up to 32 Gb/s (based on 1 GHz clock) per stream used.

When ``TP_API = 1``, the FIR will have stream API input and output ports, allowing greater interoperability and flexibility in placement of the design.
Streaming interfaces can be configured to connect single or dual stream inputs (driven by ``TP_DUAL_IP``) or one or two stream outputs (driven by ``TP_NUM_OUTPUTS``).

In general, stream based filters require less or no data buffering and therefore have less memory requirements and lower latency than window API filters.

.. note:: AIE-ML and AIE-MLv2 devices only support a single input/output port.

.. note:: AIE-ML and AIE-MLv2 devices cannot take advantage of the symmetry of FIRS; therefore the FIRs implementation is always based on an asymmetric design.

**Asymmetric FIRs**

Asymmetric FIRs (single-rate, as well as rate-changing FIRs) will use input and output streams directly.
As a result, there is no need for input/output buffering, hence Asymmetric FIRs offer very low latency and very low memory footprint.
In addition, due to the lack of memory requirements, such designs can operate on a very large number of samples within each kernel iteration (``TP_INPUT_WINDOW_VSIZE`` is limited to ``2^31 - 1``) achieving maximum performance and maximum throughput.

For example, a single kernel (``TP_CASC_LEN = 1``), 16 tap single-rate asymmetric FIR implemented on AIE device, that is using ``cint16`` data with frame size of `25600` and ``int16`` coefficients, is offering throughput of `998 MSa/s` (based on 1 GHz AI Engine clock) and latency as low as tens of nanoseconds.

**Hybrid Streaming interface for Symmetric and Half-band FIRs in non-SSR mode**

Symmetric FIRs, including half-band FIRs, cannot take full advantage of input streams when operating in a non-SSR mode, i.e., ``TP_SSR``, ``TP_PARA_INTERP_POLY``, and ``TP_PARA_DECI_POLY`` are all set to 1.
Instead, the input stream will be converted to a window buffer ,and the FIR kernels will operate in a window based architecture.
Output data will be sent directly out through a stream port.
Such designs allow a more flexible connection and mapping onto AI Engine tiles.
Latency is reduced, when compared to a window based equivalent, but is much greater than compared with an asymmetric design. Lack of an output buffer also reduces the memory requirements.

For example, a 16 tap single-rate symmetric FIR implemented on AIE device with a `512` sample input/output window operating on ``cint16`` data and ``int16`` coefficients achieves a throughput of `978 MSa/s` (based on 1 GHz AI Engine clock) and will need around `1.4 us` before a full window of samples is available for the consumer to read.

**Symmetric and Half-band FIRs in SSR mode**

When operating in a SSR mode, i.e. ``TP_SSR``, ``TP_PARA_INTERP_POLY`` or ``TP_PARA_DECI_POLY`` are greater than 1, all Symmetric and Half-band FIRs, in addition to all Asymmetric FIRs, will operate on input and output streams directly, offering very low latency and a minimal memory footprint.

For example, a 32 tap, single-rate symmetric FIR implemented on AIE device with a SSR set to 2 (``TP_SSR = 2``), using ``cint16`` data with frame size of `25600` and ``int16`` coefficients achieves throughput of `1998 MSa/s` (based on 1 GHz AI Engine clock) and latency as low as tens of nanoseconds.

.. _FIR_STREAM_OUTPUT:

Stream Output
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Stream output allows computed data samples to be sent directly over the stream without the requirement for a ping-pong window buffer.
As a result, memory use and latency are reduced.
Furthermore, the streaming output allows data samples to be broadcast to multiple destinations.

To maximize the throughput, FIRs can be configured with two output stream ports. However, this might not improve performance if the throughput is limited by other factors, i.e., the input stream bandwidth or the vector processor.
Set the ``TP_NUM_OUTPUTS`` template parameter to 2, to create a FIR kernel with two  output stream ports.
In this scenario, the output data from the two streams is split into chunks of 128-bits. E.g.:

* samples 0-3 to be sent over an output stream 0 for cint16 data type,

* samples 4-7 to be sent over an output stream 1 for cint16 data type.

Stream Input for Asymmetric FIRs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Stream input allows data samples to be written directly from the input stream to one of the Input Vector Registers without the requirement for a ping-pong window buffer.
As a result, the memory requirements and latency are reduced.

To maximize the throughput, FIRs can be configured with two input stream ports. Although this might not improve performance if the throughput is limited by other factors, i.e., the output stream bandwidth or the vector processor.
Set ``TP_DUAL_IP`` to 1, to create a FIR instance with two input stream ports.
In such a case, the input data will be merged from the two ports in 128 bit chunks, onto one data stream internally, e.g.:

* samples 0-3 to be received on an input stream 0 for cint16 data type,

* samples 4-7 to be received on an input stream 1 for cint16 data type.

.. note::  For the single rate asymmetric option, dual input streams offer no throughput gain if a single output stream is used. Therefore, dual input streams are only supported with two output streams.

Stream Input for Symmetric FIRs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Symmetric FIRs require access to data from two distinctive areas of the data stream and therefore require memory storage.
In symmetric FIRs, the stream input is connected to an input ping-pong window buffer through a DMA port of a Memory Module.

.. _FIR_FRAME_SIZE:

Setting FIR Frame Size
----------------------

FIR Frame size selection, through the FIR Graph's ``TP_INPUT_WINDOW_VSIZE`` template parameter is limited by a variety of factors, including a FIR variant or input interface type.
FIR kernels operate on the frame size provided using heavy pipelining and code repetition to schedule vector multiply-accumulate (VMAC) operations as frequently as possible.
As a result, FIRs architectures can use a ``repetition_factor`` of up to 8 to achieve the best scheduling and therefore performance.
Taking into account that each vector operation might calculate four or eight output samples at a time, the selection of ``TP_INPUT_WINDOW_VSIZE`` can be allowed in increments of, e.g., 64.

Furthermore, rate-changing FIRs require the frame size to be divisible by ``TP_DECIMATION_FACTOR`` to fully process input data samples within the optimized loop.

Additionally, in SSR mode (see :ref:`SSR_OPERATION_MODES`), the user provided frame size is distributed across all input phases of the graph.

Therefore, the FIR graph's frame size ``TP_INPUT_WINDOW_VSIZE`` must be divisible by ``TP_SSR * TP_DECIMATION_FACTOR * Repetition_factor``.

An invalid selection will report a message in a form of Metadata error or a `static_assert()` with rule violation details and a suggestion of how to fix it.

.. _FIR_LENGTH:

Setting FIR Length
------------------

The minimum FIR length is set to 1.

Single Rate FIRs have no restriction placed on the FIR length selection.

However, rate-changing FIRs require each of the individual kernels to operate on a FIR length divisible by the Decimation or Interpolation factor, imposing limits on the FIR length, e.g., ``TP_FIR_LEN % TP_DECIMATE_FACTOR == 0`` or ``TP_FIR_LEN % TP_INTERPOLATE_FACTOR == 0``.

In SSR modes, see :ref:`SSR_OPERATION_MODES`; coefficients are distributed equally across all output paths. As a result, the total number of FIRs coefficients must be divisible by number of paths, i.e., ``TP_FIR_LEN % (TP_SSR) == 0``.
For rate-changing FIRs this raises additional limits on the FIR length, where FIR length can be described by e.g.: ``TP_FIR_LEN % (TP_SSR * TP_PARA_INTERP_POLY * TP_PARA_DECI_POLY) == 0``.

.. note:: An invalid selection will report a message in a form of a Metadata error or a `static_assert()` with the rule violation details and a suggestion of how to fix it.

.. _MAX_FIR_LENGTH:

Maximum FIR Length
------------------

| The maximum FIR length, which can be supported, is limited by a variety of factors.
| Each of these factors, if exceeded, will result in a compile-time failure with some indication of the nature of the limitation.

Maximum Window Based FIRs Length
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When using a window-API for instance, the window buffer must fit into a 32 kByte memory bank, and because this includes the margin, it limits the maximum window size. Therefore, it also indirectly sets an upper limit on ``TP_FIR_LEN``.

In addition, the `single_buffer()` constraint is needed to implement window buffers of > 16 kB. For more details, refer to: :ref:`SINGLE_BUFFER_CONSTRAINT`.

As a guide, a single rate symmetric FIR can support up to:

- 8k for 16-bit data, i.e., int16 data

- 4k for 32-bit data, i.e., cint16, int32, float

- 2k for 64-bit data, i.e., cint32, cfloat

| Another limiting factor when considering an implementation of a high order FIRs is the Program Memory and sysmem requirements.
| Increasing the FIR length requires greater amounts of heap and stack memory to store coefficients. Program Memory footprint also increases as the number of instructions grows.
| As a result, a single FIR kernel can only support a limited amount of coefficients. Longer FIRs have to be split up into a design consisting of multiple FIR kernels using the ``TP_CASC_LEN`` parameter.

Maximum Stream based FIRs Length
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| When using a stream based API, the architecture uses internal vector registers to store data samples, instead of window buffers, which removes the limiting factors of the window-based equivalent architecture.
| However, the internal vector register is only 1024-bits wide, which greatly limits the amount of data samples each FIR kernel can operate on.
| In addition, data registers storage capacity will be affected by decimation factors, when a Decimation FIR is used.
| As a result, the number of taps each AI Engine kernel can process, limited by the capacity of the input vector register, depends on a variety of factors, like data type, coefficient type, and decimation factor.

To help find the number of FIR kernels required (or desired) to implement requested FIR length, refer to the helper functions: :ref:`MINIUM_CASC_LEN`, :ref:`OPTIMUM_CASC_LEN` described below.

.. _MINIUM_CASC_LEN:

Minimum Cascade Length
----------------------

| To help find the minimum supported ``TP_CASC_LEN`` value for a given configuration, the following utility functions have been created in each FIR's graph file.
| The function signature for the single rate asymmetric filter is as follows:

.. code-block::

   template<int T_FIR_LEN, int T_API, typename T_D, typename T_C, unsigned int SSR>
   static constexpr unsigned int getMinCascLen();

where T_FIR_LEN is the tap length of the FIR; T_API refers to thee type of port interface: 0 for a window API and 1 for a stream API. T_D and T_C are the data type and coeff type respectively. SSR is the parallelism factor set for the super sample rate operation.

.. code-block::

      using fir_graph = xf::dsp::aie::fir::sr_sym::fir_sr_asym_graph<DATA_TYPE, COEFF_TYPE, FIR_LEN, SHIFT, RND, INPUT_WINDOW_VSIZE>;

      static constexpr int kMinLen = fir_graph::getMinCascLen<FIR_LEN, API, DATA_TYPE, COEFF_TYPE, TP_SSR>();

      xf::dsp::aie::fir::sr_sym::fir_sr_asym_graph<DATA_TYPE, COEFF_TYPE, FIR_LEN, SHIFT, RND, INPUT_WINDOW_VSIZE,
                                                   kMinLen, USE_COEFF_RELOAD, NUM_OUTPUTS, API, SSR> firGraphWithMinLen;


More details are provided in the :ref:`API_REFERENCE`.

.. _OPTIMUM_CASC_LEN:

Optimum Cascade Length
----------------------

| For FIR variants configured to use streaming interfaces, i.e., ``TP_API = 1``, the optimum ``TP_CASC_LEN`` for a given configuration of the other parameters is a complicated equation. Here, the optimum value of ``TP_CASC_LEN`` refers to the least number of kernels that the overall calculations can be divided, when the interface bandwidth limits the maximum performance.
| To aid in this determination, utility functions have been created for FIR variants in their respective graph files.
| As an example, the function signature for the single rate asymmetric filter is shown below:

.. code-block::

   template<int T_FIR_LEN, typename T_D, typename T_C, int T_PORTS, unsigned int SSR>
   static constexpr unsigned int getOptCascLen();

where T_FIR_LEN is the tap length of the FIR, T_D and T_C are the data type and coeff type respectively, and T_PORTS refers to the single/dual ports. SSR is the parallelism factor set for the super sample rate operation.

An example use of the getOptCascLen and getMinCascLen is shown below. You can first declare a dummy graph of the FIR type you need, and use the dummy graph to call the static functions with the actual parameters with which you want the configure the graph.

.. code-block::

      using fir_graph = xf::dsp::aie::fir::sr_sym::fir_sr_asym_graph<DATA_TYPE, COEFF_TYPE, FIR_LEN, SHIFT, RND, INPUT_WINDOW_VSIZE>;

      static constexpr int kOptLen = fir_graph::getOptCascLen<FIR_LEN, DATA_TYPE, COEFF_TYPE, NUM_OUTPUTS, TP_SSR>();

      xf::dsp::aie::fir::sr_sym::fir_sr_asym_graph<DATA_TYPE, COEFF_TYPE, FIR_LEN, SHIFT, RND, INPUT_WINDOW_VSIZE,
                                                   kOptLen, USE_COEFF_RELOAD, NUM_OUTPUTS, API, SSR> firGraphWithOptLen;


More details are provided in the :ref:`API_REFERENCE`.

.. _SSR_OPERATION:

Super Sample Rate
-----------------

The term Super Sample Rate strictly means the processing of more than one sample per clock cycle. Because the AI Engine is a vector processor, almost every operation is SSR by this definition, making it superfluous. Therefore, in the AI Engine context, SSR is taken to mean an implementation using multiple computation paths to improve performance at the expense of additional resource use.

.. _SSR_OPERATION_MODES:

Super Sample Rate - Operation Modes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the FIR, SSR operation can be achieved using one of the following modes:

- :ref:`SSR_OPERATION_COEFF_DATA_DISTRO`: Driven by the ``TP_SSR`` template parameter. The mode will create an array of ``TP_SSR^2`` kernels and create the ``TP_SSR`` amount of the **input** and **output** ports.
- :ref:`SSR_OPERATION_PARA_DECI_POLY`: Driven by the ``TP_PARA_DECI_POLY`` template parameter. The mode will create a vector of ``TP_PARA_DECI_POLY`` kernels and create the ``TP_PARA_DECI_POLY`` amount of the **input** ports.
- :ref:`SSR_OPERATION_PARA_INTERP_POLY`: Driven by the ``TP_PARA_INTERP_POLY`` template parameter. The mode will create a vector of ``TP_PARA_INTERP_POLY`` kernels and create data a ``TP_PARA_INTERP_POLY`` amount of the **output** ports.

.. _SSR_OPERATION_RESOURCE_UTILIZATION:

Super Sample Rate - Resource Utilization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The number of AI Engine tiles used by a FIR will be given by the formula:

.. code-block::

  NUMBER_OF_AIE_TILES = TP_CASC_LEN * TP_SSR * TP_SSR * TP_PARA_INTERP_POLY * TP_PARA_DECI_POLY

Examples of this formula are given in the following table.

.. _SSR_OPERATION_PORT_UTILIZATION:

Super Sample Rate - Port Utilization and Throughput
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The number of input/output ports created by a FIR will be given by the formula:

* Number of input ports: ``NUM_INPUT_PORTS  = TP_PARA_DECI_POLY x TP_SSR x (TP_DUAL_IP + 1)``

* Number of output ports: ``NUM_OUTPUT_PORTS  = TP_PARA_INTERP_POLY x TP_SSR x TP_NUM_OUTPUTS``

Therefore, the maximum throughput achievable for a given data type, e.g., cint16 and 1 GHz AI Engine Clock, can be estimated with:

* maximum theoretical sample rate at input: ``THROUGHPUT_IN  = NUM_INPUT_PORTS x 1 GSa/s``,

* maximum theoretical sample rate at output: ``THROUGHPUT_OUT  = NUM_OUTPUT_PORTS x 1 GSa/s``.


**AI Engine Tile Utilization Ratio**

A Super Sample Rate operation creates multiple computation paths that are used to produce the output samples.
Having multiple computation paths reduces the amount of computation required by each kernel.

The total number of FIR computation paths can be described with the following formula:

.. code-block::

  NUMBER_OF_COMPUTATION_PATHS = TP_CASC_LEN  * TP_SSR * TP_PARA_INTERP_POLY * TP_PARA_DECI_POLY

The FIR graph will try to split the requested FIR workload among the FIR kernels equally, which can mean that each kernel is tasked with a comparatively low computational effort.

In such a scenario, the bandwidth will be limited by the amount of ports, but the AI Engine tile utilization ratio (often defined as ratio of VMAC operations to cycles without VMAC operation) might be reduced.

For example, a 32 tap Single Rate FIR operating on a ``cint16`` data type and ``int16`` coefficients with ``TP_SSR`` set to 2 and a cascade length ``TP_CASC_LEN`` set to 2 will perform at the bandwidth close to `2 GSa/s` (2 output stream paths). Each of the kernels will be tasked with computing only eight coefficients. The design will use eight FIR kernels mapped to eight AI Engine tiles to achieve that.
However, a similarly configured FIR, a 32 tap Single Rate FIR operating on ``cint16`` data type and ``int16`` coefficients with ``TP_SSR`` set to 2, but without further cascade configuration (``TP_CASC_LEN`` set to 1) would also perform at the bandwidth close to `2 GSa/s` but only consume four kernels to achieve that.

**Rate-changing FIR Throughput**

| For rate changers, the bandwidth of either the input or output port, depending on whether it is a decimator or an interpolator, can limit the throughput of the filter.
| For example, an interpolator with an interpolation factor of 3 produces three times the number of outputs as inputs. However, the AI Engine stream port bandwidth is the same for the input and output.
| Hence, if the output runs at maximum bandwidth, the input would need to run at 1/3rd its maximum bandwidth, and you are forced to underutilize the input stream of the filter at only 33 percent efficiency.
| However, if you are able to split the operation of the interpolator over three kernels, broadcast the input stream to their inputs, and operate the kernels at maximum performance, it will be possible to use both the input and output bandwidths at their maximum bandwidths.

.. _SSR_OPERATION_COEFF_DATA_DISTRO:

Super Sample Rate - Coefficient and Data Distribution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The base mode of SSR is driven by the use of the ``TP_SSR``template parameter.
The ``TP_SSR`` parameter allows a trade of performance for resource use in the form of tiles used.

When used, a number of ``TP_SSR`` input phases and a number of ``TP_SSR`` output paths will be created.
An array of ``TP_SSR^2`` FIR sub-graphs will be created to connect the input phases and output paths.

Input data samples are distributed across the input phases in a round-robin, sample-by-sample mechanism where each input phase processes a fraction of the input samples, i.e. ``TP_INPUT_WINDOW_VSIZE / TP_SSR``. More details in: :ref:`SSR_PORT_MAPPING`.

Coefficients are distributed in such way that each output path consists of all the FIRs coefficients, but each FIR sub-graph in any given output path is only configured to operate on a fraction of the FIR length, i.e., operates on ``TP_FIR_LEN / TP_SSR`` number of coefficients.

As a result, each FIR sub-graph operates on a fraction of coefficients and a fraction of the data, giving an overall increased performance.

In addition, each FIR sub-graph can be further split into multiple FIR kernels with the use of a cascade interface, which is driven by the ``TP_CASC_LEN`` template parameter.

For example, a FIR with ``TP_SSR = 4`` and ``TP_CASC_LEN = 2`` will create a kernel structure presented as follows, in :ref:`FIGURE_FIR_SSR`.

.. _FIGURE_FIR_SSR:

.. figure:: ./media/SSR_FIR_6_5in.png


   **Internal structure of FIR with TP_SSR = 4 and TP_CASC_LEN = 2**

Super Sample Rate - Coefficient and Data Distribution - Resampling Limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The resampling process requires input data samples to be "reused" in a computation of multiple output samples, as per the ``TP_INTERPOLATION_FACTOR/TP_DECIMATION_FACTOR`` configuration. Because a given input data sample might be required by more than one output path, but not all the output paths, it is not possible to create efficient data distribution connections that would take advantage of extra resources without fully decomposing into Interpolation Polyphases and Decimation Polyphases fist .

Therefore, Resampling only supports ``TP_SSR`` mode when ``TP_PARA_INTERP_POLY = TP_INTERPOLATION_FACTOR`` and ``TP_PARA_DECI_POLY = TP_DECIMATION_FACTOR``.

.. _SSR_PORT_MAPPING:

Super Sample Rate - Sample to Port Mapping
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a Super Sample Rate operation is used, data is input and output using multiple ports. These multiple ports on input or output, act as one channel.

The input data channel must be split over multiple ports where each successive input sample is sent to a different input port in a round-robin fashion, i.e., sample 0 goes to input port :code:`in[0]`, sample 1 to :code:`in[1]`, etc. up to ``N-1`` where ``N = TP_SSR``, then sample N goes to :code:`in[0]`, sample N+1 goes to :code:`in[1]` and so on. Output samples are output from the multiple output ports in the same fashion.

In addition, where ``TP_DUAL_IP`` is also enabled, there will be two sets of SSR input ports, :code:`in` and :code:`in2`, where data must be organized in a 128-bit interleaved pattern.
Allocate samples to ports 0 to N-1 of port :code:`in` in the round-robin fashion above until each port has 128-bits of data, then allocate the next samples in a round-robin fashion to ports 0 through N-1 of port :code:`in2` until these have 128-bits of data, then return to allocating samples to ports 0 through N-1 of :code:`in`, and repeat.

For example, if you have a data stream like :code:`int32 x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ...`, then an SSR of 3 with dual input ports would look like:

.. code-block::

  in[0] = 0, 3, 6, 9, 24, 27, 30, 33, ...
  in[1] = 1, 4, 7, 10, 25, 28, 31, 34, ...
  in[2] = 2, 5, 8, 11, 26, 29, 32, 35, ...
  in2[0] = 12, 15, 18, 21, 36, 39, 42, 45, ...
  in2[1] = 13, 16, 19, 22, 37, 40, 43, 46, ...
  in2[2] = 14, 17, 20, 23, 38, 41, 44, 47, ...

The output data will be produced in a similar method.
Samples will be sent to each port in a round-robin fashion, in addition being organized in 128-bit interleaved patterns when two output ports are in use, i.e., when ``TP_NUM_OUTPUTS`` is set to 2.

.. _SSR_OPERATION_PARA_INTERP_POLY:

Super Sample Rate - Interpolation Polyphases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the method described above, :ref:`SSR_OPERATION`, FIR can decompose the interpolation process into multiple parallel polyphases using the ``TP_PARA_INTERP_POLY`` template parameter.

When used, a ``TP_PARA_INTERP_POLY`` number of output paths will be created.

.. note:: The total number of output paths will be the result of the multiplication of: ``NUM_OUTPUT_PORTS  = TP_PARA_INTERP_POLY x TP_SSR``.

The polyphases are executed in parallel and the output data produced by each polyphase directly becomes the filter's output.
``TP_PARA_INTERP_POLY`` does not affect the number of input data paths. It is only useful when the filter has an interpolation factor greater than 1.

For example, when ``TP_SSR = 1``, and ``TP_PARA_INTERP_POLY = 3``, the input stream would look like:

.. code-block::

   in[0] = i0, i1, i2, i3, i4, i5, i6, i7, i8, ...

And the output stream would look like:

.. code-block::

   out[0] = o0, o3, o6, o9, o12, o15, ...
   out[1] = o1, o4, o7, o10, o13, o16, ...
   out[2] = o2, o5, o8, o11, o14, o17, ...

When ``TP_SSR = 1``, ``TP_PARA_INTERP_POLY = 4``, the input stream would still be the same as before, because ``TP_PARA_INTERP_POLY`` only affects the number of output streams.
The output stream would look like:

.. code-block::

   out[0] = o0, o4, o8, o12, ...
   out[1] = o1, o5, o9, o13, ...
   out[2] = o2, o6, o10, o14, ...
   out[3] = o3, o7, o11, o15, ...

And when ``TP_SSR = 2``, ``TP_PARA_INTERP_POLY = 3``, the input stream would need to look like this:

.. code-block::

   in[0] = i0, i2, i4, i6, i8, i10, ...
   in[1] = i1, i3, i5, i7, i9, i11, ...

The output stream would produce data in this form:

.. code-block::

   out[0] = o0, 06, o12, o18, o24, ...
   out[1] = o1, o7, o13, o19, o25, ...
   out[2] = o2, o8, o14, o20, o26, ...
   out[3] = o3, o9, o15, o21, o27, ...
   out[4] = o4, o10, o16, o22, o28, ...
   out[5] = o5, o11, o17, o23, o29, ...

You see that you can think of ``TP_SSR x TP_PARA_INTERP_POLY`` as an effective ``OUT_SSR`` which gives you the maximum output sample rate of the filter.

.. _SSR_OPERATION_PARA_DECI_POLY:

Super Sample Rate - Decimation Polyphases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the methods described above, FIR can decompose the decimation process into multiple polyphases using the ``TP_PARA_DECI_POLY`` template parameter.

| The effect of ``TP_PARA_DECI_POLY`` is to remove the bottleneck posed by the input bandwidth on the overall throughput of the FIR filter.
| In decimators, every DECIMATE_FACTOR number of inputs produce one more output. So, when the input streams are utilized at their maximum bandwidth, the output stream can only be utilized at 1/DECIMATE_FACTOR of their maximum bandwidth. With ``TP_PARA_DECI_POLY > 1``, use the ``TP_PARA_DECI_POLY`` number of input phases to provide extra input stream bandwidth.
| The input data stream is split into ``TP_PARA_DECI_POLY`` input data phases. Outputs from these input phases are then added together to produce the overall filter's output.

.. note:: The total number of input phases will be the result of multiplication of: ``NUM_INPUT_PORTS  = TP_PARA_DECI_POLY x TP_SSR``.

For example, when ``TP_SSR = 1``, and ``TP_PARA_DECI_POLY = 3``, the input stream would look like:

.. code-block::

   in[0] = i0, i3, i6, i9, ...
   in[1] = i1, i4, i7, i10, ...
   in[2] = i2, i5, i8, i11, ...

The output stream would have SSR output paths and look like:

.. code-block::

   out[0] = o0, o1, o2, o3, o4, ...

For ``TP_SSR = 1``, ``TP_PARA_DECI_POLY = 4``, the input stream would look like:

.. code-block::

   in[0] = i0, i4, i8, ...
   in[1] = i1, i5, i9, ...
   in[2] = i2, i6, i10, ...
   in[3] = i3, i7, i11, ...

The output stream would look the same as in the previous configuration because ``TP_PARA_DECI_POLY`` only affects the number of input streams.

When ``TP_SSR = 2``, ``TP_PARA_DECI_POLY = 3``, the input stream would look like:

.. code-block::

   in[0] = i0, i6, i12, i18, i24, ...
   in[1] = i1, i7, i13, i19, i25, ...
   in[2] = i2, i8, i14, i20, i26, ...
   in[3] = i3, i9, i15, i21, i27, ...
   in[4] = i4, i10, i16, i22, i28, ...
   in[5] = i5, i11, i17, i23, i29, ...

the output stream would look like:

.. code-block::

   out[0] = o0, o2, o4, o6, o8, o10, ...
   out[1] = o1, o3, o5, o7, o9, o11, ...

Should it be necessary to apply constraints within the FIR instance to achieve successful mapping of the design, you need to know the internal instance names for graph and kernel names. See :ref:`FIGURE_FIR_SSR`.

Each FIR variant has a variety of access methods to help assign a constraint on a kernel and/or a net, e.g.:

- `getKernels()` which returns a pointer to an array of kernel pointers, or

- `getInNet()` which returns a pointer to a net indexed by method's argument(s).

More details are provided in the :ref:`API_REFERENCE`.

An example of how to use this is given in the section :ref:`FIR_CODE_EXAMPLE`.
When configured for a SSR operation, the FIR has a two-dimensional array (paths x phases) of units which are themselves FIRs, though each atomic FIR in this structure can itself be a series of kernels as described by ``TP_CASC_LEN``. The `getKernels()` access function returns a pointer to the array of kernels within the SSR FIR. This array will have ``TP_SSR * TP_SSR * TP_CASC_LEN`` members. The index in the array is determined by its path number, phase number and cascade position as shown in the following equation.

.. code-block::

   Kernel Index = Kernel Path * TP_SSR * TP_CASC_LEN + Kernel Phase * TP_CASC_LEN + Kernel Cascade index

For example, in a design with ``TP_CASC_LEN = 2`` and ``TP_SSR = 3``, the first kernel of the last path would have an index 12.

The nets returned by the `getInNet()` function can be assigned custom fifo_depths values to override the defaults.

Configuration Notes
===================

This section is intended to provide guidance on how best to configure the FIRs in some typical scenarios, or when designing with one particular metric in mind, such as resource use or performance.

**Configuring for Requirements Based on Performance Versus Resource Use**

The least resource-expensive method to obtain higher performance is to use the dual ports features, i.e., ``TP_DUAL_IP`` = 1 and/or ``TP_NUM_OUTPUTS`` = 2.

| The next method that offers higher performances at lower resource costs is the ``TP_PARA_{INTERP/DECI}_POLY`` parameter.
| ``TP_PARA_X_POLY`` can take a minimum value of 1 and a maximum value equal to the interpolation factor or the decimation factor. It can increase in steps of the integer factors of the interpolation or decimation factor.
| It is important to note that, the advantage of higher throughput comes at the cost of additional AI Engine tiles. When you set the ``TP_PARA_X_POLY`` parameter, the graph creates a number of ``TP_PARA_X_POLY`` polyphase paths. Each path contains ``TP_CASC_LEN`` kernels. The number of tiles used will be ``TP_PARA_X_POLY * TP_CASC_LEN``, i.e., ``TP_PARA_X_POLY`` is a single dimensional expansion.

| ``TP_SSR`` is the parameter that enables finer control over the throughput and AI Engine tiles use.
| The number of tiles used will be ``TP_CASC_LEN * TP_SSR * TP_SSR``, i.e., SSR is a 2-dimensional expansion. Both methods can work in addition to the ``TP_CASC_LEN`` parameter which also increases the number of tiles. ``TP_SSR`` can take any positive integer value and its maximum is only limited by the number of AI Engine tiles available. This can be used to prevent overutilization of kernels if the throughput requirement is not as high as the one offered by ``TP_PARA_X_POLY``.

``TP_CASC_LEN`` indicates the number of kernels to be cascaded together to distribute the calculation of the ``TP_FIR_LEN`` parameter. It works in addition to ``TP_SSR`` and ``TP_PARA_X_POLY`` to overcome any bottlenecks posed by the vector processor. The library provides access functions to determine the value of ``TP_CASC_LEN`` that gives you the optimum performance, i.e., the minimum number of kernels that can provide the maximum performance. More details can be found in :ref:`API_REFERENCE`.

If there is no constraint on the number of AI Engine tiles, the easiest way to get the required performance is to set the ``TP_PARA_X_POLY`` to the closest factor of the interpolation/decimation rate that is higher than the throughput needed. If, however, the goal is to obtain a performance using the least number of tiles, ``TP_SSR`` might need to be used as a finer tuning parameter to get the throughput you want.

**SCENARIO 1:**

| For a 64 tap interpolate by 5 filter that needs 4 GSa/s at output:
| ``TP_PARA_INTERP_POLY`` can only be set to 5; this would need at least five AI Engine tiles. The optimum cascade length is 2. This would use 10 AI Engine tiles and give you 10 GSa/s at the output.
| On the other hand, setting ``TP_SSR = 2`` and ``TP_PARA_INTERP_POLY = 1`` will be able to do that in four AI Engine tiles, and the maximum throughput at the output would be 4 GSa/s.

**SCENARIO 2:**

| For a 32 tap interpolate by 2 filter that needs 4 GSa/s at output:
| ``TP_PARA_INTERP_POLY`` can be set to 2. This would create two output paths and so, at least two AI Engine tiles. Say that the optimum cascade length for the data_type/coeff_type combination is 2. Set ``TP_CASC_LEN = 2``.
| The optimum cascade lengths for the various parameters can be obtained using the helper functions in :ref:`API_REFERENCE`. With these two output paths, it is possible to obtain the required sample rate of 4 GSa/s.

**SCENARIO 3:**

| For a 32 tap interpolate by 2 filter that needs 8 GSa/s at output:
| ``TP_PARA_INTERP_POLY`` can be set to 2 (which is the maximum value). This would create a maximum of two output paths which can only have a maximum throughput of 4 GSa/s.
| Because ``TP_PARA_INTERP_POLY`` cannot be increased further, use the ``TP_SSR`` parameter to increase the throughput available. Setting ``TP_SSR = 2`` will double the total available throughput by doubling the input and output paths.
| Note that the optimum cascade length in this case would be different.
