 *
 * These are the templates to configure the 2D FFT class.
 * @tparam TT_DATA_D1 describes the type of individual data samples input to and
 *         output from the first transform function. \n
 *         This is a typename and must be one of the following: \n
 *         int16, cint16, int32, cint32, float, cfloat.
 * @tparam TT_DATA_D2 describes the type of individual data samples input to and
 *         output from the second transform function. \n
 *         This is a typename and must be one of the following: \n
 *         int16, cint16, int32, cint32, float, cfloat.
 * @tparam TT_TWIDDLE describes the type of twiddle factors of the transform. \n
 *         It must be one of the following: cint16, cint32, cfloat
 * @tparam TP_POINT_SIZE_D1 is an unsigned integer which describes the number of samples in
 *         the first transform. \n This must be 2^N where N is an integer in the range
 *         4 to 16 inclusive.
 * @tparam TP_POINT_SIZE_D2 is an unsigned integer which describes the number of samples in
 *         the second transform. \n This must be 2^N where N is an integer in the range
 *         4 to 16 inclusive.
 * @tparam TP_FFT_NIFFT selects whether the transform to perform is an FFT (1) or IFFT (0).
 * @tparam TP_SHIFT selects the power of 2 to scale the result by prior to output.
 * @tparam TP_CASC_LEN selects the number of kernels the FFT will be divided over in series
 *         to improve throughput
 * @tparam TP_WINDOW_VSIZE_D1 is an unsigned integer which describes the number of samples to be processed in each call
 *to the\n
 *         to the function. By default, TP_WINDOW_SIZE_D1 is set to match TP_POINT_SIZE_D1. \n
 *         TP_WINDOW_SIZE_D1 may be set to be an integer multiple of the TP_POINT_SIZE_D1, in which case
 *         multiple FFT iterations will be performed on a given input window, resulting in multiple
 *         iterations of output samples, reducing the numer of times the kernel needs to be triggered to
 *         process a given number of input data samples. \n
 *         As a result, the overheads inferred during kernel triggering are reduced and overall performance
 *         is increased.
 * @tparam TP_WINDOW_VSIZE_D2 is an unsigned integer which describes the number of samples to be processed in each call
 *to the\n
 *         to the function. By default, TP_WINDOW_SIZE_D2 is set to match TP_POINT_SIZE_D2. \n
 *         TP_WINDOW_SIZE_D2 may be set to be an integer multiple of the TP_POINT_SIZE_D2
 * @tparam TP_API is an unsigned integer to select window (0) or stream (1) interfaces.
 *         When stream I/O is selected, one sample is taken from, or output to, a stream and the next sample
 *         from or two the next stream. Two streams minimum are used. In this example, even samples are
 *         read from input stream[0] and odd samples from input stream[1].
 * @tparam TP_RND describes the selection of rounding to be applied during the
 *         shift down stage of processing. \n
 *         Although, TP_RND accepts unsigned integer values descriptive macros are recommended where
 *         - rnd_floor      = Truncate LSB, always round down (towards negative infinity).
 *         - rnd_ceil       = Always round up (towards positive infinity).
 *         - rnd_sym_floor  = Truncate LSB, always round towards 0.
 *         - rnd_sym_ceil   = Always round up towards infinity.
 *         - rnd_pos_inf    = Round halfway towards positive infinity.
 *         - rnd_neg_inf    = Round halfway towards negative infinity.
 *         - rnd_sym_inf    = Round halfway towards infinity (away from zero).
 *         - rnd_sym_zero   = Round halfway towards zero (away from infinity).
 *         - rnd_conv_even  = Round halfway towards nearest even number.
 *         - rnd_conv_odd   = Round halfway towards nearest odd number. \n
 *         No rounding is performed on ceil or floor mode variants. \n
 *         Other modes round to the nearest integer. They differ only in how
 *         they round for values of 0.5. \n
 *
 *         Note: Rounding modes ``rnd_sym_floor`` and ``rnd_sym_ceil`` are only supported on AIE-ML and AIE-MLv2 device.
 *\n
 * @tparam TP_SAT describes the selection of saturation to be applied during the shift down stage of processing. \n
 *         TP_SAT accepts unsigned integer values, where:
 *         - 0: none           = No saturation is performed and the value is truncated on the MSB side.
 *         - 1: saturate       = Default. Saturation rounds an n-bit signed value
 *         in the range [- ( 2^(n-1) ) : +2^(n-1) - 1 ].
 *         - 3: symmetric      = Controls symmetric saturation. Symmetric saturation rounds an n-bit signed value in the
 *range [- ( 2^(n-1) -1 ) : +2^(n-1) - 1 ]. \n
 * @tparam TP_TWIDDLE_MODE describes the magnitude of integer twiddles. It has no effect for cfloat. \n
 *         - 0: Max amplitude. Values at 2^15 (for TT_TWIDDLE=cint16) and 2^31 (TT_TWIDDLE=cint32) will saturate and so
 *introduce errors
 *         - 1: 0.5 amplitude. Twiddle values are 1/2 that of mode 0 so as to avoid twiddle saturation. However,
 *twiddles are one bit less precise versus mode 0.
